Problem statement:
Farmers who grow potatoes and tomatoes face a lot of economic losses every year because of various diseases that can happen to these plants. There are two common diseases: early blight and late blight. Early blight is caused by fungas, and late blight is caused by a specific microorganism. If farmers can detect early and apply appropriate treatment, it can save a lot of waste and prevent economic loss.

Collected data and implemented data cleaning and preprocessing using the TF dataset and data augmentation strategies to enhance model training. Built and trained a CNN model with TensorFlow, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy, early blight, and late blight plant leaf conditions. Developed a FastAPI backend and built a React.js web interface that calls the FastAPI server upon uploading a plant leaf image; it then predicts and displays the labelâ€”whether it's healthy, early blight, or late blight. Deployed the model on the Google Cloud Platform using cloud functions to manage serverless operations and ensure seamless service availability.
