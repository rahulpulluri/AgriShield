# Plant Disease Classification

**Problem statement:**
Farmers who grow potato and tomato facing lot of economic losses every year because of various disease that can happen to a potato plant. There are two comman diseases early blight and late blight, early blight is caused by fungas and late blight is caused by a specific micro-organism and if farmer can detect early and apply appropriate treatment then it can save lot of waste and prevent the economic loss.

**Project Execution:**
Collected data and implemented data cleaning and preprocessing using tf dataset and data augmentation strategies to enhance model training. Built and trained a CNN model with TensorFlow, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy, early blight, and late blight plant leaf conditions. Developed a FastAPI backend and built a React.js web interface that calls the FastAPI server upon uploading a plant leaf image; it then predicts and displays the labelâ€”whether it's healthy, early blight, or late blight. Deployed the model on Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Functions to manage serverless operations and ensure seamless service availability.
